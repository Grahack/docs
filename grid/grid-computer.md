While grid is a completely open tool, re-imaginable by the artist who's using it, let's begin with a few fixed starting points.

### serialosc (required) {#serialosc}

grid uses serialosc to communicate back and forth with applications on your computer. Once you install it, it runs in the background and converts serial communication (over USB) into Open Sound Control (OSC). Applications query serialosc to connect to grid and arc, so while you'll never interact with serialosc directly, it's necessary to have installed before we do anything else.

To begin, [check out the serialosc docs](/docs/serialosc/setup).

### scripting

The grid is *intended* to be reimagined. Once serialosc is installed, you can give the grid purpose and meaning that's all your own: instrument, experiment, tool, toy...choose your own adventure!

#### studies

Letâ€™s start with some introductory knowledge: potential energy for radical creative freedom.

The following tutorials (written for macOS, Windows and Linux) show how to use different languages and environments to achieve the same goal: a playable step sequencer which interfaces with the grid.

- [SuperCollider](/docs/grid/studies/sc) // synthesis engine and programming environment
- [Puredata](/docs/grid/studies/pd) // open-source graphical patching for audio processing
- [Max](/docs/grid/studies/max) // a highly refined graphical patching environment
- [Arduino](/docs/grid/studies/arduino) // embedded programming to connect grids to external hardware
- [Processing](/docs/grid/studies/processing) // integrated development environment for visual experimentation
- [Python](/docs/grid/studies/python) // general purpose programming language
- [Node.js](/docs/grid/studies/nodejs) // web-centric script programming platform

#### extended knowledge

Additional resources to help you exercise greater control over the grid's serial messages, modify serialosc itself, or build your own grid libraries using C:

- [serialosc programming docs](/docs/serialosc/osc) // extend or re-program serialosc
- [monome serial protocol](/docs/serialosc/serial.txt) // API for serial messages
- [libmonome](https://github.com/monome/libmonome) // a library which simplifies serial communication with the grid, which serialosc is built on
- [libmonome tutorial](/docs/libmonome/tutorial) // control grid with libmonome + C

### community starting points {#community}

The grid was originally designed as a flexible, minimal interface to control Max patchers. Over the past 15+ years many artists have extended this simple purpose into full-blown performance tools and, through their *immense* generosity, openly shared them back to the community:

- [Max + Max for Live](/docs/grid/computer/max) (macOS + Windows)
- [Mark Eats Sequencer](/docs/grid/computer/mark-eats) (macOS only)
